The‬‎‎‬‎‬ architecture‬‎‎‬‌‎ of‬‎‭‎‎‌ a‬‎‎‬‌‭ ConvNet‬‎‭‎‎‬ is‭‭‭‭‭‭ analogous to that of the connectivity pattern of Neurons in the Human Brain and was inspired by the organization of the Visual Cortex. Individual neurons respond to stimuli only in a restricted region of the visual field known as the Receptive Field. A collection of such fields overlap to cover the entire visual area.
