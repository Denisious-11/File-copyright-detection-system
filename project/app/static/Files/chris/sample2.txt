At‬‎‎‬‎‬ this‬‎‎‬‌‎ point‬‎‭‎‎‌ instead‬‎‎‬‌‭ of‬‎‭‎‎‬ applying‭‭‭‭‭‭ EqualizeHist over the entire image, we will instead create a CLAHE object. This built-in model of OpenCV is similar and allows us to pass in two additional key parameters. Firstly, we need to specify our input image. Secondly, we can define a ClipLimit (threshold for contrast change). Lastly, we provide the local area size to which equalization will be performed.
