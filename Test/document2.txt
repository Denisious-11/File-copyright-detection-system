We find the keypoints and descriptors of each spefic algorythm.
A keypoint is the position where the feature has been detected, while the descriptor is an array containing numbers to describe that feature.

When the descriptors are similar, it means that also the feature is similar. You can see this tutorial to understand more about feature matching.
